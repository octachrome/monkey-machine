= Monkey machine =

A basic Turing-machine-like game. You try to achieve a specific goal by writing rules that tell the monkey what to do based on the current game state. The game state consists of a) which fruit is currently under the monkey, and b) the monkey's mood. The rule can swap the fruit for a different fruit, and can modify the monkey's mood, activating another set of rules.
